	 <h3>Info about Pluto's atmosphere</h3>
	 <div>
        Early data suggested that Pluto's atmosphere loses 1027–1028 molecules
		(50–500 kg) of nitrogen per second, an amount corresponding to the loss
		of a surface layer of volatile ices several hundred meters or several
		kilometers thick during the lifetime of the Solar System.[1][6][48] However,
		subsequent data from New Horizons revealed that this figure was overestimated
		by at least four orders of magnitude; Pluto's atmosphere is currently losing
		only 1×1023 molecules of nitrogen and 5×1025 molecules of methane every second.
		This presumes a loss of several centimeters of nitrogen ice and several dozen
		meters of methane ice during the lifetime of the Solar System

	  <h3>Info about The Milky Way</h3>
	  <div>
	The Milky Way is our home galaxy. The Sun is just one of the billions of stars that exist in this galaxy. From here on Earth, the part of it that we see looks like a milky band of light across the sky. We do not know exactly how many stars are in our galaxy. However, it is estimated to be around billions. The number of planets is believed to be just as many too.

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy. Aside from the spiral arms, it has a prominent bar structure in the center. About 90% of it is made up of dark matter, an unknown and invisible component that glues the galaxy together. A very massive black hole lies in its core to
