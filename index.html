	 <h3>Info about Pluto's atmosphere</h3>
	 <div>
        Early data suggested that Pluto's atmosphere loses 1027–1028 molecules
		(50–500 kg) of nitrogen per second, an amount corresponding to the loss
		of a surface layer of volatile ices several hundred meters or several
		kilometers thick during the lifetime of the Solar System.[1][6][48] However,
		subsequent data from New Horizons revealed that this figure was overestimated
		by at least four orders of magnitude; Pluto's atmosphere is currently losing
		only 1×1023 molecules of nitrogen and 5×1025 molecules of methane every second.
		This presumes a loss of several centimeters of nitrogen ice and several dozen
		meters of methane ice during the lifetime of the Solar System
